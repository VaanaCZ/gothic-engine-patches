// Fix for broken Gothic 2 Classic climbing mechanics (yes, it really are broken)
//
// In Sequel and G2 Classic, there is a feature where if the hero
// stands up next to a ledge that is climbable, their head will
// tilt up to look at it. Problem is the game keeps requerying the
// climbable ledges while the hero is already in the air, meaning
// that if any ledge suddenly becomes reachable, the hero will
// change to climbing it instead.
//
// I won't bother porting this fix to Sequel
